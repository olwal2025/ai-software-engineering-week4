### ⚖️ Ethical Reflection: Bias in Predictive Modeling

#### 🔍 The Possible Biases in the Dataset

The dataset used in this predictive model is the **Kaggle Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic (WBCD)** dataset, which may exhibit several forms of bias that can impact the fairness and accuracy of predictions:

* **Lack of demographic representation**: The dataset may underrepresent specific groups (age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status), leading to unfair outcomes for those populations (Wilkerson et al., 2024).
* **Selection bias**: The dataset likely includes only patients with access to healthcare, excluding those from underserved communities.
* **Data quality issues**: Missing, inconsistent, or erroneous data can reduce the model's performance and exacerbate unfairness (Nugroho, 2023).

#### 🧰 Equity Tools: IBM AI Fairness 360

To mitigate such biases, **IBM AI Fairness 360** provides several fairness-enhancing algorithms:

* **Fairness-aware model selection**: Selects models optimized for fairness (Varshney, 2018).
* **Model parameter adjustment**: Modifies learning parameters to reduce biases.
* **Bias-reducing data preprocessing**: Normalizes, scales, and balances the dataset.

#### 🛠️ How to Handle Dataset Biases

To build fairer models:

* 📊 **Data collection**: Use diverse sources to ensure broad demographic coverage.
* 🧹 **Preprocessing**: Normalize data, handle missing values, and remove outliers.
* ⚖️ **Fair model selection**: Choose algorithms that prioritize fairness.
* 🔧 **Adjust models**: Tune parameters to align with fairness objectives.

> By integrating fairness tools and improving dataset diversity, we can create AI systems that make accurate and **equitable predictions** for all users.
