Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.
manual
def sort_dicts_by_key(dicts, sort_key):
    """
    Sorts a list of dictionaries by the specified key.
    Dictionaries missing the key are placed at the end.
    """
    return sorted(dicts, key=lambda d: d.get(sort_key, float('inf')))
    Ai implementation
    def sort_dicts_by_key(dicts, key):
    return sorted(dicts, key=lambda x: x.get(key, float('inf')))
    Compare the AI-suggested code with your manual implementation.
    Both implementations call Python’s highly-optimized sorted() exactly once, compute the same list of keys, and use identical fallback logic. Consequently they have the same asymptotic and real-world performance.
    
 Analysis   
Both the manual and AI-generated implementations leverage Python’s built-in sorted() function with a lambda as the key function. This approach is not only concise but also efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of dictionaries in the list. In both cases, missing keys are handled by providing a default value (float('inf')), ensuring that dictionaries lacking the sort key are placed at the end of the sorted list. The resulting code is both readable and maintainable.

The main difference lies in code style: the AI-suggested version is more succinct, omitting docstrings and explanatory comments. While this brevity is attractive for experienced developers, the manual version’s documentation enhances clarity, especially for newcomers or future maintainers. Efficiency-wise, both perform identically, as they use the same language features under the hood.

In conclusion, both approaches are equally efficient in terms of execution. However, the manual version is slightly more maintainable due to its explicit documentation, whereas the AI-suggested version prioritizes brevity. For production code, combining the clarity of manual documentation with the succinctness of the AI’s implementation would yield the best results.
